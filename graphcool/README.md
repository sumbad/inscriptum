## Welcome to the new Graphcool Framework!

Your project has just been upgraded and is ready for usage with the Graphcool CLI.

In order to use the new CLI, please install it first:
```sh
$ npm install -g graphcool
```

## Project Structure
The central configuration of your upgraded Service lives in the `graphcool.yml`.
There, all your permissions, functions and types are tied together.
You can find your schema in the `types.graphql`.

## Deployment
To deploy changes of your service, just execute
```sh
$ graphcool deploy
```

## Resources
### CLI

Or execute `graphcool` to see the usage overview.
### graphcool.yml
